## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Butter will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

###Beta versions

Beta releases will be numbered with the following format:

`0.<major>.<minor>-<patch>`

###Stable versions

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`


Constructed with the following guidelines:
* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
